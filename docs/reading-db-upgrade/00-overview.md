# Reading DB Upgrade — Overview

## Purpose

The goal of this upgrade is to create a central, database-backed reading library for initkOA.

The current site has a resource catalog at `/play`. It is useful for surfacing links, videos, podcasts, books, Medium articles, GitHub pages, and other external resources. However, `/play` is not designed to store or render full-text documents.

The new system introduces `/reading` as a dedicated section for full-text documents.

```txt
/play    = resource catalog
/reading = full-text document library
````

This distinction is foundational.

## Problem

The current Medium import workflow adds article metadata into:

```txt
public/inventory.articles.catalog.json
```

That means the site can display article cards, titles, descriptions, topics, and external URLs. But the article bodies remain outside the site, usually on Medium.

This creates several limitations:

1. AI systems cannot reliably read the full article text from initkOA.
2. The site does not control the long-term availability of the text.
3. Search is limited to metadata unless the full body is stored elsewhere.
4. `/play` becomes overloaded if it tries to serve both as a resource catalog and a full reading library.
5. Large-scale document management becomes difficult once the project grows to hundreds of documents.

The target system must support documents ranging from short articles to long texts of 1–100 pages or more.

## Target architecture

The target architecture uses Supabase Postgres as the central source of truth for readable documents.

```txt
Supabase Postgres
  ↓
documents
document_topics
document_versions
document_chunks
document_assets
  ↓
Next.js server-rendered routes
  ↓
/reading
/reading/[slug]
```

The full document body is stored in the database, not only as an external link.

The site renders each published document as a server-side HTML page so it is accessible to:

* human readers;
* search engines;
* AI crawlers;
* internal AI/discovery artifacts;
* future semantic search and retrieval workflows.

## Core decision

```txt
Supabase Postgres = central source of truth
```

Supabase is selected because the project will likely need more than simple SQL storage:

* document metadata;
* full Markdown body;
* plain-text body for search;
* topics;
* versions;
* import logs;
* source files;
* full-text search;
* future vector search with pgvector;
* optional Storage for original files.

Neon Postgres remains a valid alternative for a leaner database-only setup, but Supabase is the preferred default for this upgrade because it combines Postgres, admin tooling, Storage, auth, SQL, full-text search, and future pgvector support.

## Key terms

### Resource

A resource is a catalog item, often an external reference.

Examples:

```txt
Medium link
YouTube video
Spotify podcast
Amazon book
GitHub wiki
PhilPapers article
External website
```

Resources belong primarily to `/play`.

### Document

A document is a full-text readable entity stored in the central database.

Examples:

```txt
Medium article copied into the DB
Markdown essay
PDF with extracted text
Manual long-form page
Research note
Whitepaper
Book chapter
```

Documents belong primarily to `/reading`.

### Source

The source describes where the document came from.

Valid initial sources:

```txt
medium
markdown
pdf
manual
imported_html
```

### Canonical URL

The canonical URL is the original external source URL.

For a Medium import, this is the original Medium article URL.

```txt
canonical_url = "https://medium.com/..."
```

### Internal URL

The internal URL is the initkOA reading route.

```txt
internal_path = "/reading/cartographer-of-ideas"
```

### Body Markdown

The normalized Markdown body stored in the DB.

```txt
body_markdown
```

### Body Text

The plain-text version derived from `body_markdown`, used for search and AI workflows.

```txt
body_text
```

### Chunk

A chunk is a section of a document prepared for AI/search workflows.

Chunks are not the canonical document. They are derived from the canonical body.

```txt
document_chunks
```

### Asset

An asset is an original file or media object linked to a document.

Examples:

```txt
original .md file
original Medium HTML export
source PDF
image
attachment
```

## Existing system

The current system already includes:

```txt
/play
public/inventory.articles.catalog.json
scripts/import-medium-rss.mjs
content/medium/source/*.html
```

The Medium importer currently updates the public inventory catalog.

That workflow is useful and should not be discarded. However, it should become part of a larger reading pipeline.

The future flow should be:

```txt
Medium RSS / Medium HTML / Markdown / PDF
  ↓
import pipeline
  ↓
Supabase Postgres documents
  ↓
/reading/[slug]
  ↓
AI/search/discovery artifacts
```

## Relationship between `/play` and `/reading`

`/play` should remain a broad resource catalog.

It should continue to support:

```txt
videos
podcasts
books
external articles
GitHub resources
tools
platform links
```

`/reading` should serve full-text documents.

It should support:

```txt
articles
essays
papers
long-form notes
imported Markdown
imported Medium copies
PDF text extractions
manual documents
```

When a Medium article is copied into the DB, `/play` may still show it as a resource, but the primary URL should eventually point to the internal reading page:

```txt
/reading/cartographer-of-ideas
```

The original Medium URL remains available as `canonical_url`.

## Target routes

Initial public routes:

```txt
/reading
/reading/[slug]
/reading/source/[source]
/reading/topic/[topic]
```

Future admin route:

```txt
/admin/reading
```

Existing route preserved:

```txt
/play
```

## Document lifecycle

Documents move through a simple lifecycle:

```txt
draft
published
archived
```

### Draft

The document exists in the DB but is not publicly visible.

### Published

The document is visible at:

```txt
/reading/[slug]
```

### Archived

The document is hidden from normal browsing but retained in the DB.

## Migration phases

### Phase 0 — Documentation

Document the architecture, data model, import pipeline, UI, and AI accessibility requirements.

Documents:

```txt
docs/reading-db-upgrade/00-overview.md
docs/reading-db-upgrade/01-data-model.md
docs/reading-db-upgrade/02-import-pipeline.md
docs/reading-db-upgrade/03-nextjs-reading-ui.md
docs/reading-db-upgrade/04-ai-accessibility.md
```

### Phase 1 — Supabase schema

Create the core Supabase Postgres schema.

Initial tables:

```txt
documents
document_topics
document_versions
document_chunks
document_assets
import_runs
import_items
```

### Phase 2 — Medium import to DB

Create a new importer:

```txt
scripts/import-medium-to-reading-db.mjs
```

It should import from:

```txt
Medium RSS
content/medium/source/*.html
```

It should write to:

```txt
documents
document_topics
document_assets
import_runs
import_items
```

### Phase 3 — Reading UI

Create the public reading section:

```txt
app/reading/page.tsx
app/reading/[slug]/page.tsx
app/reading/layout.tsx
```

The document body must be rendered server-side.

### Phase 4 — Markdown import

Create a Markdown importer:

```txt
scripts/import-reading-md-to-db.mjs
```

It should support dropping `.md` files into an import directory, parsing metadata, and inserting/updating DB records.

Default import directory:

```txt
content/reading-inbox
```

### Phase 5 — Search and AI chunks

Add:

```txt
Postgres full-text search
document_chunks
optional pgvector embeddings
```

Initial search should use Postgres full-text search.

Future search can use hybrid retrieval:

```txt
text search + vector search + metadata filters
```

### Phase 6 — Admin UI

Add:

```txt
/admin/reading
```

This can eventually support:

```txt
review imports
edit metadata
publish/unpublish
manage topics
view import logs
inspect chunks
```

## Environment variables

Initial variables:

```txt
DATABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
MEDIUM_RSS_URL
MEDIUM_SOURCE_DIR
READING_IMPORT_DIR
```

The service role key must only be used in trusted server-side scripts or server-only code.

It must not be exposed to client-side components.

## Package scripts

Current relevant script:

```txt
npm run import:medium
```

Future scripts:

```txt
npm run reading:import
npm run reading:sync
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

The existing Medium catalog import can remain while the DB-backed reading pipeline is introduced.

## SEO and AI rules

Published reading documents must be rendered as server-side HTML.

Do not rely on client-only fetching for the document body.

Rules:

```txt
Only status=published documents are public.
Use canonical_url for original external source when applicable.
Keep internal /reading/[slug] stable after publication.
Render full document text server-side.
Expose published documents to AI discovery artifacts when appropriate.
Do not expose draft or private documents.
```

## Slug rules

Slugs should be:

```txt
lowercase
kebab-case
stable after publication
unique
human-readable
```

Default slug source:

```txt
title
```

Collision strategy:

```txt
append short hash
```

Example:

```txt
cartographer-of-ideas
cartographer-of-ideas-a13f92
```

## Search rules

### Phase 1

Use Postgres full-text search over:

```txt
title
description
body_text
topics
source
author
```

### Phase 2

Add vector embeddings in:

```txt
document_chunks
```

### Phase 3

Use hybrid search:

```txt
full-text search
+ vector search
+ metadata filters
```

## Non-goals for the first implementation

The first implementation should not attempt to solve everything.

Non-goals:

```txt
full CMS editing
collaborative editing
PDF OCR at scale
semantic search UI
multi-user permissions
private document sharing
automatic summarization
automatic topic taxonomy
```

Those can come later.

The first implementation should focus on:

```txt
central DB schema
Medium/local HTML import
Markdown import
server-rendered /reading pages
basic filters
basic search
AI-visible published text
```

## Summary

This upgrade separates two concerns:

```txt
/play    = catalog of resources and external references
/reading = full-text document library backed by Supabase Postgres
```

The immediate value is that initkOA can host its own readable corpus instead of only linking to external sources.

The long-term value is that the corpus becomes searchable, versioned, AI-accessible, and extensible to hundreds or thousands of documents.
